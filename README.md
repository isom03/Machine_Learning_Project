# Machine_Learning_Project
Western Governor's University  Capstone Project - Real Estate Price Predictor

This program was built in Jupyter Notebook using Python. It takes King County housing data from Kaggle.com, which is then cleaned and analyzed. Once the data has been prepped it's used to train a machine learning model to predict real estate prices. If a user knows the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage of the property, lot size of the property, and the zip code of the property the program will be able to provide a price estimate for the property.
